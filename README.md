# bunsen: Robust Estimation with Covariate Adjustment for Survival Endpoint in Clinical Trials

The bunsen package aims to provide a robust and easy-to-use interface for estimating marginal or unconditional Hazard Ratio (HR) and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) when adjusting prognostic covariates in clinical trials.

## Methodology

bunsen is developed based on three key papers:

-   HR: [Rhian Daniel et al. (2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bimj.201900297)
-   RMST: [Theodore Karrison et al. (2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1740774518759281)
-   Extension of above two methods: [Jiawei Wei et al. (2024)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19466315.2023.2292774)
