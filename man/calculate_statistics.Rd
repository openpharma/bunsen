\title{Estimate the marginal causal survival curves}
\usage{
calculate_statistics(model, data, type, trt, bh)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted \link[survival]{coxph} model. This should be a coxph event model or censoring model.}

\item{data}{A data frame used in the coxph model. This data will be used for calculating the potential outcomes.}

\item{type}{Numeric. 1 for the treatment group. 0 for the control or placebo group.
Used in calculating the potential outcomes for corresponding groups.}

\item{trt}{Character. Name of the treatment assignment variable.}

\item{bh}{A data frame from the \link[survival]{basehaz} function. This is the baseline hazard for the coxph model.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the marginal causal survival curves. Each number is the probability of the surviving the time window
(t1,t2],... conditional on surviving the prior corresponding window.
}
\description{
Estimate the marginal causal survival curves for simulating time-to-event data in a discrete manner
based on the methods from Daniel et al.(2020).
}
\details{
If the study period for the original data is divided into discrete windows,
defined by the event times in the original data, at time t0 = 0, everyone in the simulated data is still a survivor.
S(x) is the estimated survival function. By the end of the window (0,t1], a proportion S(t1) still survives.
The conditional probability of surviving the next window, (t1,t2], conditional on surviving the first window,
is S(t2)âˆ•S(t1), and so on. This function returns the S(t2)/S(t1) in series.
}
\examples{
library(survival)
data('oak')

cox_event <- coxph(Surv(OS, os.status) ~ trt+btmb+pdl1, data=oak)
bh <- basehaz(cox_event, centered = FALSE)
calculate_statistics(model=cox_event,data=oak,type=1,trt='trt',bh=bh)
